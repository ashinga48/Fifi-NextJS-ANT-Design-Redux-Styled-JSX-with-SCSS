A boilerplate with [NextJS](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/) + [ANT Design](ant.design) + Redux + [Styled JSX with SCSS](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zeit/next-sass)


With a lot of research and experimentation NextJS is the best framework to work with React JS ( Server side rendering + Code Splitting ) and better performance.

whereas working with [React Starter Kit](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit) doesn't give better output for production ( like Code Splitting ) ( please share if you know how to do it ).

### What it has

- [x] SCSS
- [x] Seperate SCSS files

### Things to do

- [ ] Integrate ANT design
- [ ] Integrate Redux



Many other UI frameworks like Grommet, Materialise CSS etc are doing a good job. I see ANT Design is much more sophisticated.

### How

```
npm run dev
```

### Extra

If you are looking something for production like project
- [React Universally](https://github.com/ctrlplusb/react-universally) has "Now" based deployments, but doesn't have UI framework
